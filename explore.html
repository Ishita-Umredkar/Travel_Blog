            </h1>
            <p>
                North of Auckland, this area has some of the best opportunities for dolphin and whale watching, relaxing on the beach, swimming, boating, and eating seafood. The area is very low-key and is a popular summer and weekend getaway destination for Aucklanders. The Waitangi Treaty Grounds, one of the most important historical sites in the country, is also located here. Today, there are two interactive and interesting museums here as well as Maori cultural performances you can attend.

                3. See the Waitomo Glowworm Caves
            </h1>
            <p>
                Explore these incredible caves in sheer darkness with nothing but the glow of glowworms to guide your way. It’s an exciting activity as you float down rivers and jump over waterfalls and watch the “starry sky” in the cave. You can also tube and abseil (rappel) through the caves, too. Expect to pay around 55 NZD for the classic 45-minute cave tour and 265 for five-hour tours with abseiling. You can save money overall by purchasing combo tickets or by going on weekdays when you get 20% off.

            4. Hike the Tongariro Alpine Crossing
           </h1>
           <p>
            Labeled the best one-day hike in New Zealand, this epic trek near Taupo traverses Tongariro National Park, a World Heritage Site and New Zealand’s oldest national park. You walk through volcanic terrain (including where they filmed Mordor in Lord of the Rings), near high peaks and sulfur lakes, before finishing off in a dense forest. The 19-kilometer (12-mile) walk takes a full day and is actually quite challenging. Expect to pay around 40 NZD per person for a shuttle to and from the trail.

            </h1>
            <p>
                One of the popular adventure activities in New Zealand is skydiving. The best place for this is over Lake Taupo.

                2. Brave the elements on a glacier walk
            </h1>
            <p>
                There are opportunities to experience the glaciers for people with all levels of ability. You can follow the walking tracks up to the terminus of either glacier for a close up view or hike through the bush to a viewing point. And if actually touching the ice is on your bucket list then a guided tour (with all equipment included) will allow you to get up onto the glacier face itself.
