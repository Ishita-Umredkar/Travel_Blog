# Travel_Blog
Welcome to my travel blog website repository! This is a collection of code and files that make up the front-end of my first travel blog website. It features details, images and tips about tourist destinations. It also has a sample reviews section. The website features a clean and modern design, with easy-to-navigate pages.
The code is properly written and I have put comments wherever necessary.
This is my first website and I tried to keep it simple with just HTML and CSS. This is a basic website and would appear properly on desktop screen.
